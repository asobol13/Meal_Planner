### The end goal:
***
The end goal of this program is to have a working web application that allows a user to randomly choose their meals for the week so they don't have to plan it out! They would also be able to customize it themselves by choosing their own meals or adding their meals in as well. Down the line I would also like to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner options. # Meal_Planner
